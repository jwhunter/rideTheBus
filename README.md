# rideTheBus
This repository contains a simulation of the "Ride The Bus" card game.

This project simulates perfect, reasonable logic performed on the Ride The Bus game. It collects numbers of guesses performed on each round and numbers of losses. This project is useful because it gives an expected value of the number of points a good player could expect to collect per round.

Users can get started by simply sourcing rideTheBus.R and executing simLoop.R. exploration.R is a (very) quick glance at the results.
